This risk was reduced to 2.3 (95% CI: 0.5 to 11.2) if patients received the higher cumulative dosage with the same CYP2C19*1/*2 (G/A) or*2/*2 (A/A) genotypes but this was non-significant.

CYP2C19 Genotyping Results in Clopidogrel Allocated Subjects: Intermediate metabolizer (N=357) -*1A/*2A, *1A/*3, *1A/*4, *1A/*8; Poor metabolizer (N=38) *2A/*2A, *2A/*3, *2A/*4, *2A/*5A, *2A/*8. The *2 allele (rs4244285) accounted for 95% of the subjects who were classified as carriers of a reduced-function allele. Carriers of a *2 allele (rs4244285) had a higher rate of the primary efficacy outcome (HR: 1.42; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.05; P=0.04) and of stent thrombosis (HR: 3.33; 95% CI, 1.28 to 8.62; P=0.004) than did noncarriers.

On multivariate analysis, AA race (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% CI 1.08-3.81), carrier of CYP2C19*2 allele (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22-3.53), and age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were independent correlates for PRU ¿208. All patients received a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel 6 hours before platelet reactivity testing or a 75-mg maintenance dose for 5 days before testing. All patients received aspirin 325 mg 6 to 24 hours before testing. After the procedure, aspirin was prescribed indefinitely; and clopidogrel was prescribed for a minimum of 1 month in patients receiving bare metal stents for elective PCI, and for 12 months in patients receiving DES and in all patients with acute coronary syndrome.

The AUClast was 2.35-fold greater in PMs vs EMs, and 1.27-fold greater in IMs vs EMs. The intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) for Cmax was 44% greater in PMs vs EMs, and 22% greater in IMs vs EMs. The intrasubject CV for AUClast was 71% greater for PMs vs EMs, and 135% greater for IMs vs EMs. However, no statistical analyses were provided for these differences. The authors also note that one individual with the *1/*17 genotype had an AUClast close to that of the EM group, and one with the *2/*17 genotype had an AUClast close to that of the IM group. Two voriconazole formulations were studied in this paper (SYP-1018 and Vfend), and these results apply to both formulations.

Please note that the authors did not specify if all of these genotypes were present in their population, only that they genotyped patients for them. Additionally, the authors grouped patients based on metabolizer status (homozygous extensive metabolizer, heterozygous extensive metabolizer, poor metabolizer) without discussing which genotypes were present in these groups; however, this information was inferred based on multiple previous studies that used these genotypes (e.g. PMID 15903128, 15470328, 15447734).

Patients already had initial treatment with lansoprazole for 8 weeks, they then received the drug for 6 months as maintenance therapy. At the end of this time period, remission rate was analyzed. Please note that the authors did not explicitly identify the *2 or *3 alleles, rather they specified the exons in which these variants occur (5 and 4, respectively). Additionally, the authors did not specify whether each of the *2/*2, *2/*3 or *3/*3 genotypes were present in the population.

Nevertheless, this association did not retain statistical significance after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Moreover, the plasma trough concentration of LCM in nonresponders with wild GG genotypes was significantly lower than those responders with GA or AA genotypes (Figure 3). These findings suggest that individuals who have a better efficacy should have higher plasma concentrations, which was consistent with previous research.18,32 However, no statistical difference in concentration between responders and nonresponders was observed in our study."""

A 10-year-old female was diagnosed with standard risk early precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She developed a suspected fungal infection, and was administered 9.5 mg/kg of voriconazole over 12 hours. The steady-state voriconazole trough concentration at day 7 was 0.2 mcg/ml. Due to subtherapeutic concentrations, therapy was switched to amphotericin B, but then switched back to voriconazole with a loading dose of 14 mg/kg on day 1 followed by 12 mg/kg every 12 hours. After dosage increase, trough concentration was 1.1 mcg/ml. Patient was found to be a rapid metabolizer with the *1/*17 genotype.

Tamoxifen arm (20mg/day) of an ongoing German prospective observational multicenter breast cancer trial (IKP211) with the following inclusion primary breast cancer (pT1–4; N1–2; M0) were postmenopausal status, positive ER status, past administration of an adequate adjuvant chemotherapy, and past or concomitant radiation therapy.  Plasma samples at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year after the commencement of tamoxifen treatment. DNA was extracted from blood and samples were analyzed for the CYP2D6 alleles *3, *4, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *41 by means of individual TaqMan allelic discrimination assays and CYP2D6 TaqMan Gene Copy Number Assay for gene deletion (*5) and duplication. PM alleles (*3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8), IM alleles (*9, *10, *41), and EM alleles (absence of any PM or IM allele), as PM/PM, PM/IM, IM/IM, PM/EM, IM/EM, or EM/EM. The UM phenotype was derived from the presence of at least one duplicated EM and the absence of a variant allele, i.e., EM/UM. All variants, except CYP2D6*5, were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.
